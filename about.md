I'm currently working at Broadway Technology in New York City working on mission-critical fintech trading systems in a client-facing software engineering role.

I work on all phases of the software product lifecycle: engaging with clients to gather complex business requirements; designing and refining implementation plans to satisfy project requirements; implementing software enhancements and bug fixes to reach deliverables; and deploying and supporting end-to-end solutions in production environments.
