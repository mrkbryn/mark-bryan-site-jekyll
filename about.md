I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at ï£¿Apple on the Apple Pay Team in New York City. Previously, I was working at Broadway Technology in New York City working on fintech trading systems.

I graduated from Cornell University in 2018 where I studied Computer Science and participated in research in Database Systems with a focus on the problem of Data Vocalization.
