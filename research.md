## Data Vocalization: Optimizing Voice Output of Relational Data

* August 2017
* Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, Volume 10
* [Read the paper](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p1574-trummer.pdf)

Research on data visualization aims at finding the best way to present data via visual interfaces. We introduce the complementary problem of 'data vocalization.' Our goal is to present relational data in the most efficient way via voice output. This problem setting is motivated by emerging tools and devices (e.g., Google Home, Amazon Echo, Appleâ€™s Siri, or voice-based SQL interfaces) that communicate data primarily via audio output to their users

## Vocalizing Large Time Series Efficiently

* July 2018
* Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, Volume 11
* [Read the paper](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1563-trummer.pdf)

We vocalize query results for time series data. We describe a holistic approach that integrates query evaluation and vocalization. In particular, we generate only those parts of the query result that are relevant for voice output..."
