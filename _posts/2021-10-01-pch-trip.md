During my recent job transition, I took off two weeks in between jobs and decided to take a solo trip from Los Angeles up to San Francisco along the Pacific Coast Highway. This trip had been on my bucket list for a long time, and I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to cross this trip off.

_Trip Itinerary_

* Los Angeles / Santa Monica (2 days)
* Santa Barbara (2 days)
* Monterey / Carmel (3 days)
* San Francisco (3 days)

## Los Angeles / Santa Monica

I flew into Los Angeles and started my trip out by staying in Santa Monica.

## Day Hike at Channel Islands

While in Santa Barbara, I decided to dedicate an entire day to a trip to Santa Cruz Island in the Channel Islands National Park. Early one morning, I drove back down to Ventura to catch a ferry out to the island.

The views and the colors of the landscape were incredible. It was a bit foggy in the morning, but cleared up towards the afternoon.

## Drive up PCH through Big Sur

After leaving Santa Barbar, I ventured out on the largest leg of my trip - the trek up the PCH from Santa Barbara to Monterey. This had to have been the most beautiful drive ever!

I stopped at a few different lookout points along the road to snap a few pictures.

## Monterey and Carmel

Finally, I made it up to Monterey. When I hit each new location, I took a few hours to let myself wander around the town. Here's a picture near Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey.

While I stayed in Monterey, I also ventured over to Carmel to wander around the town and lay out on the picturesque Carmel Beach.

Staying in line with the hiking theme of the trip, I also took a day hike in the Point Lobos State Reserve.

## San Francisco

In the last leg of my trip, I arrived in San Francisco. On Saturday, my friend and I went hiking in Marin at the Tennessey Valley area.
