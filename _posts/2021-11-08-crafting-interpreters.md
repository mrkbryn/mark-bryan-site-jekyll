title: "Crafting Interpreters"

Over the past year I've been following along with Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com) book. This book provides a great introduction to anyone who wants to learn more about how programming languages are written and it helps demystify how programming languages, virtual machines, and compilers work.

My implementation (and ports to other languages) are over on the [Lox](https://github.com/mrkbryn/lox) repo on my GitHub.
